# Minigame Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Survival Mode**
- ✅ **Enemy Spawning**: Fixed enemy particles not spawning properly by correcting the render reference access
- ✅ **Collider Selector**: Added collider selection UI with limit tracking (15 colliders max)
- ✅ **Collider Limit**: Implemented proper collider limit enforcement
- ✅ **Canvas Size**: Fixed canvas size to be properly responsive (600px height, 100% width up to 1400px)
- ✅ **Enemy Movement**: Improved enemy force application for better movement toward core

### 2. **Collection Mode**
- ✅ **Zone Behavior**: Fixed zones to only delete particles when correctly sorted (matching colors)
- ✅ **Wrong Sort Penalty**: Particles in wrong zones now bounce off instead of being deleted
- ✅ **Particle Spawning**: Improved spawn rate and spread for better gameplay
- ✅ **Zone Size**: Increased zone size from 80px to 120px for better visibility
- ✅ **Cursor Mode**: Changed cursor to "grab" style to indicate dragging is the primary interaction
- ✅ **No Colliders**: Disabled collider placement in collection mode (limit set to 0)
- ✅ **Mouse Interaction**: Disabled particle spawning on click/drag, only physics-based dragging allowed

### 3. **Challenge Mode**
- ✅ **Win Condition**: Fixed objective progress tracking to properly trigger win state
- ✅ **Collider Limit**: Added 10 collider limit with UI display
- ✅ **Collider Selector**: Added collider selection UI for strategic placement

### 4. **Reaction Mode**
- ✅ **Win Condition**: Fixed objective progress tracking for destroyed particles
- ✅ **Explosion Tracking**: Properly tracks explosions used vs max explosions
- ✅ **No Colliders**: Disabled collider placement (limit set to 0)
- ✅ **Particle Destruction**: Each particle destroyed by explosion now properly increments progress

### 5. **Coin Rewards System**
- ✅ **Win Reward**: All minigames now award **5 coins** for winning
- ✅ **Loss Reward**: All minigames now award **1 coin** for losing
- ✅ **Display**: Updated GameHUD to show correct coin rewards on win/loss screen
- ✅ **Persistence**: Coins are properly saved to localStorage

### 6. **General Improvements**
- ✅ **Canvas Sizing**: Fixed canvas to be larger and more responsive
- ✅ **Game State Reset**: Properly resets collider mode and tool mode when starting a game
- ✅ **Collider Tracking**: Added `collidersPlaced` state to track placed colliders
- ✅ **Mode-Specific Limits**: Each game mode now has appropriate collider limits

## Technical Changes

### App.jsx
1. Added `colliderLimit` and `collidersPlaced` state variables
2. Updated `initializeGameMode` to set appropriate limits per mode
3. Modified `createCollider` to enforce collider limits in non-sandbox modes
4. Updated win/loss handling to award 5 coins for winning, 1 for losing
5. Fixed collection mode collision handling to only remove correctly sorted particles
6. Added collider selector UI for survival and challenge modes
7. Fixed canvas container sizing for better responsiveness
8. Disabled particle spawning in collection mode (drag-only interaction)

### useSurvivalMode.js
1. Fixed render reference access for enemy spawning
2. Adjusted enemy spawn positions to be inside canvas bounds
3. Increased force multiplier for better enemy movement
4. Added restitution property to enemy particles

### GameHUD.jsx
1. Updated win/loss overlay to show correct coin rewards (5 for win, 1 for loss)
2. Added encouraging message for losses

## Game Mode Specifications

| Mode | Collider Limit | Particle Spawning | Win Condition | Coins (Win/Loss) |
|------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Sandbox | Unlimited | Click/Drag | N/A | N/A |
| Challenge | 10 | Limited Budget | Reach Target | 5 / 1 |
| Survival | 15 | Auto (Enemies) | Survive 10 Waves | 5 / 1 |
| Collection | 0 | Auto (Colored) | Sort 50 Particles | 5 / 1 |
| Reaction | 0 | Pre-spawned | Destroy Target | 5 / 1 |

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Survival Mode**: Verify enemies spawn from all sides and move toward core
2. **Collection Mode**: Test that wrong-colored particles bounce off zones
3. **Challenge Mode**: Verify collider limit is enforced and displayed
4. **Reaction Mode**: Test explosion limit and particle destruction tracking
5. **Coin System**: Verify coins are awarded correctly on win/loss and persist across sessions
