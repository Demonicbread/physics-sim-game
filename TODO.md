# PhysicsBox - Expanded Features Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: New Game Modes
- [ ] Fusion Mode
[ ] Fusion Mode
- [ ] Add system to detect overlapping particle types
- [ ] Define fusion recipes (e.g., sand + water ‚Üí mud, plasma + metal ‚Üí magnetized ore)
- [ ] Create fusionHandler() for combining particles
- [ ] Add energy cost or cooldown mechanic
- [ ] Add small explosion or glow effect during fusion

[ ] Chaos Mode
- [ ] Create chaosController() that randomizes physics parameters
- [ ] Randomize gravity, air friction, wind, timeScale, restitution, etc.
- [ ] Add survival timer or score based on duration
- [ ] Add ‚Äústabilize‚Äù button to reset physics to normal

[ ] Construction Mode
- [ ] Add new body types: hinges, springs, pulleys, motors
- [ ] Create ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù tool for linking objects
- [ ] Implement basic objectives (e.g., transport a ball to a goal)
- [ ] Add stress visualization (tension color indicators)
- [ ] Allow saving/loading contraption setups

[ ] Simulation Lab
- [ ] Add preset scenarios (bridge stress test, meteor impact, magnetic storm)
- [ ] Create menu for selecting simulations
- [ ] Add scoring or success conditions for each scenario

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Physics Features

[ ] Temperature System
- [ ] Add temperature property to particles
- [ ] Define behavior: melting, freezing, vaporizing
- [ ] Explosions and plasma increase local temperature
- [ ] Create visual heatmap overlay

[ ] Pressure & Fluid Simulation
- [ ] Calculate local particle density

- [ ] Visual spark effects between charged particles

[ ] Chain Physics
- [ ] Implement spring or constraint links between particles
- [ ] Add rope/chain tool to connect multiple bodies
- [ ] Simulate snapping if tension exceeds threshold
- [ ] Optional: oscillation damping for smoother motion

## üéÆ Gameplay Systems

[ ] Achievements
- [ ] Add system for tracking player actions
- [ ] Define achievement conditions (e.g., spawn 10,000 particles, destroy 500)
- [ ] Add reward pop-ups or coin bonuses

[ ] Player Upgrades
- [ ] Add in-game shop or upgrade screen
- [ ] Create upgrade data (particle unlocks, tool boosts, visuals)
- [ ] Store purchases in localStorage
- [ ] Integrate with coin system

## üé® Visual & Immersion Features

[ ] Visual Filters
- [ ] Add toggleable filters (CRT, neon glow, dark mode, infrared)
- [ ] Implement via CSS filters or WebGL shaders

[ ] Replay System
- [ ] Record and save short simulation clips
- [ ] Add play/pause/rewind controls
- [ ] Allow exporting as GIF or video

[ ] Slow-Mo Camera
